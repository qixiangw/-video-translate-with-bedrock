1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:03,960
For over a century, I have lived in secret.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,280
Hiding in the shadows,alone in the world.

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,640
Until now.

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,760
I am a vampire.

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,840
And this is my story.

6
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,440
An hour's drive to hear that crap.

7
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,840
You know, it wasn't even a band.A guy with a guitar.

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,560
An hour each way.

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,040
-He wasn't that bad.
-He sounded like James Blunt.

10
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,560
What's wrong with that?

11
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,760
We already have a James Blunt.
One's all we need.

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,480
-So why did you come?
-Because I love you.

13
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,160
Nicely done.

14
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,160
-What's with all the fog?
-It'll clear in a second.
